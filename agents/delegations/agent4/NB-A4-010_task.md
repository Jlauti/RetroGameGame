# Task Brief

## Metadata

- Ticket ID: NB-A4-010
- Agent: agent4
- Assigned By: principal_engineer
- Assigned Date: 2026-02-25
- Due Date: 2026-02-26

## Context

Settings UI must feel native to current RetroGameGame menu language while remaining readable over active gameplay. Runtime implementation needs a clear visual baseline before final polish.

## Concrete Steps

1. Define visual/layout baseline for Settings panel:
   - hierarchy
   - spacing
   - control grouping
   - button priority for Apply/Back/Quit
2. Define styling guidance for:
   - selected vs non-selected options
   - focused/hover states
   - critical action emphasis (Quit)
3. Validate readability guidance for in-game overlay mode.
4. Identify reusable assets in `assets/ui/` and any missing asset callouts (do not create gameplay art).
5. Produce deliverable and report.

## Boundaries

- Follow ticket `Allowed Paths` only.
- No runtime code edits under `src/`.
- No model generation/editing.

## Acceptance

- Visual baseline is implementation-ready and references existing UI language.
- Readability and action hierarchy are explicitly documented.
- Acceptance commands pass.
