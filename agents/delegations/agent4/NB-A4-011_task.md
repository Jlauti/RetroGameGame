## Context

Nebula topography wave needs visual consistency guidance so runtime implementation can maintain readability with a lower camera angle and bright neon hex ground.

## Concrete Steps

1. Define neon hex visual baseline for topography tiers (palette + contrast).
2. Define readability guardrails for player/enemy/projectiles on bright terrain.
3. Provide tuning recommendations for glow/edge intensity and color separation.
4. Publish implementation-facing guidance and task report.

## Boundaries

- Follow ticket `Allowed Paths` only.
- No runtime code edits.
- No gameplay/model generation work.

## Acceptance

- Visual baseline deliverable is specific and actionable.
- Acceptance commands pass.
