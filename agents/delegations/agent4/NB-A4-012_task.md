## Context

Nebula topography is currently too visually dense and dominates the frame. Provide a compact hotfix visual pack to rebalance neon-hex readability for active gameplay at 16:9.

## Concrete Steps

1. Review current topography look from QA/HITL screenshots and identify visibility failure points.
2. Define hotfix-safe tier intensity/alpha ranges and edge/fill balance to prevent screen flooding.
3. Provide clear contrast rules so ship, enemies, and projectiles remain readable over the terrain.
4. If needed, prepare replacement overlay sprite assets for topography under allowed paths.
5. Publish implementation-facing recommendations for runtime integration.

## Boundaries

- Follow ticket `Allowed Paths` only.
- No runtime code edits.
- No gameplay balancing work.

## Acceptance

- Hotfix guidance is actionable and tuned for readability.
- Any produced assets are integration-ready.
- Acceptance commands pass.
