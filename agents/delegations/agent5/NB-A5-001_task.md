## Context

Game-feel systems depend on stable projectile and collision foundations. An initial implementation report was submitted; this round closes remaining acceptance gaps.

## Concrete Steps

1. Verify and finalize bounce cone-cast assist and heading interpolation.
2. Confirm render layer hierarchy and align all relevant spawn depths.
3. Complete damage-multiplier-based feedback: screen shake and hit-stop behavior.
4. Ensure projectile ribbons are production-usable and do not leak/stale.
5. Add concise deliverable notes in `/home/jl/git/RetroGameGame/agents/deliverables/agent5/`.

## Boundaries

- Follow allowed paths in ticket.
- No procgen rewrites.

## Acceptance

- Command gates pass.
- Include tuned constants/defaults and remaining risks in report.
