## Context

Core feel systems are in place. This task closes hit-stop behavior and tuning so feedback quality is production-usable.

## Concrete Steps

1. Implement time-scale hit-stop behavior with explicit multiplier scaling.
2. Tune shake/hit-stop interplay for readability and comfort.
3. Ensure impact feedback does not degrade control under rapid collisions.
4. Document final tuning constants and safety constraints.

## Boundaries

- Follow ticket `Allowed Paths` only.
- No procgen/topography edits.

## Acceptance

- Command gates pass.
- Deliverable notes include tuning rationale and known risks.
