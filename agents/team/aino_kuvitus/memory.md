# Aino Kuvitus Memory

## Durable Lessons

- White background prompts produce edge halos and extraction artifacts; avoid.
- Green-screen can create internal holes if the sprite itself contains greens; validate aggressively.
- Human review board with explicit APPROVE/REJECT notes improves throughput.
- Candidate staging before canonical promotion prevents accidental regressions.
- Gameplay readability beats concept detail.
- Runtime now supports `orientation_offset_deg`; capture it in metadata instead of repainting sprites for angle fixes.

## Current Focus

- NB-A4-006: finalize gameplay-fit sprite set and metadata for runtime integration.
