You are Codex Worker 1 for RetroGameGame.

Execute:

- Ticket: `/home/jl/git/RetroGameGame/agents/backlog/NB-CX-011.md`
- Delegation: `/home/jl/git/RetroGameGame/agents/delegations/codex_worker1/NB-CX-011_task.md`

Mission:

Deliver a large runtime integration pass that replaces key Nebula debug visuals with sprite-driven rendering using a config manifest, while preserving collision/gameplay behavior and keeping fallback primitives for missing assets.

Rules:

1. LOCAL execution only.
2. Obey allowed paths exactly.
3. Use `cargo-safe` for all Cargo commands.
4. Record exact command exits in report.
5. If blocked, use fallback-first implementation and include a precise escalation note instead of stalling.

Output:

- Report at `/home/jl/git/RetroGameGame/agents/reports/codex_worker1/NB-CX-011_task_report.md`.
