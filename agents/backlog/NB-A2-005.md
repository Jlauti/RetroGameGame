## Objective

Integrate `AlienFighter.glb` into Nebula Bouncer enemy runtime rendering after player-model integration is stable.

## Allowed Paths

- No art asset creation or modification.

## Acceptance Commands

- cargo test --lib nebula_bouncer
- cargo fmt -- --check

## Dependencies

- NB-A4-008 `.glb` intake/validation baseline.
- NB-A2-004 player `.glb` runtime integration.

## Definition of Done

- Enemy rendering path supports `AlienFighter.glb` from manifest-configured path.
- At least one existing enemy archetype is mapped to the model with validated scale/orientation.
- Enemy collisions, status effects, and combat interactions remain behaviorally stable.
- Runtime fallback/logging behavior is clear when model loading fails.
- Task report written to `agents/reports/agent2/NB-A2-005_task_report.md`.
