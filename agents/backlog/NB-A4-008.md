## Metadata

- Ticket ID: NB-A4-008
- Owner Agent: agent4
- Status: TODO
- Execution Lane: LOCAL
- Critical Path: YES

- Fallback Owner: agent4

## Objective

Validate and baseline the newly delivered human-created `.glb` ship assets for Nebula Bouncer:

- `assets/sprites/future/nebula_bouncer/ship_models/TechFighter.glb` (player)
- `assets/sprites/future/nebula_bouncer/ship_models/AlienFighter.glb` (enemy)

This ticket establishes the canonical load paths plus scale/orientation guidance that runtime integration tickets will consume.

## Allowed Paths

- assets/sprites/future/nebula_bouncer/ship_models/
- specs/future/nebula_bouncer/
- agents/deliverables/agent4/
- agents/reports/agent4/
- agents/backlog/NB-A4-008.md

## Out of Scope

- No gameplay code changes under `src/`.
- No creation or editing of model geometry/materials.
- No enemy behavior/system tuning.

## Acceptance Commands

- cargo check --bin retro-game-game
- cargo fmt -- --check

## Dependencies

- Human-created `.glb` models present in the paths listed above.

## Definition of Done

- Runtime loadability is validated for both models (Scene0) and documented.
- Canonical model path entries are confirmed in `specs/future/nebula_bouncer/asset_manifest.json`.
- Deliverable written to `agents/deliverables/agent4/NB-A4-008_model_validation.md` with:
  - recommended scale baselines
  - orientation assumptions
  - pivot/offset notes
  - observed render issues (if any)
- Task report written to `agents/reports/agent4/NB-A4-008_task_report.md`.
