## Objective

Prepare a fast visual hotfix pack for Nebula topography so neon-hex terrain supports gameplay readability rather than obscuring it.

Specific outcomes:
- reduce visual density and fill dominance
- preserve neon identity while improving contrast hierarchy
- provide implementation-ready values/assets for runtime integration

## Allowed Paths

- assets/sprites/future/nebula_bouncer/
- specs/nebula_bouncer.md
- docs/architecture/DESIGN.md
- agents/deliverables/agent4/
- agents/reports/agent4/
- agents/backlog/NB-A4-012.md

## Out of Scope

- No gameplay/runtime code edits under `src/`.
- No model generation/editing.
- No QA artifact writing.

## Acceptance Commands

- cargo check --bin retro-game-game
- cargo fmt -- --check

## Dependencies

- NB-A4-011 baseline guidance.
- NB-QA-020 and current HITL screenshot feedback.

## Definition of Done

- Hotfix deliverable written to `agents/deliverables/agent4/NB-A4-012_neon_hex_hotfix_pack.md` with:
  - tier alpha/intensity ranges safe for gameplay readability
  - edge-vs-fill guidance to avoid full-screen block saturation
  - contrast rules for player, enemy, and projectile visibility
  - 16:9 framing recommendations for current target layout
- If needed, updated/replacement topography overlay sprite assets are added under `assets/sprites/future/nebula_bouncer/`.
- Task report written to `agents/reports/agent4/NB-A4-012_task_report.md`.
