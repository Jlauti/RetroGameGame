# NB-A2-009 - Nebula Topography Render Hotfix (Visibility + Readability)

## Metadata

- Ticket ID: NB-A2-009
- Owner Agent: agent2
- Status: TODO
- Execution Lane: LOCAL
- Critical Path: YES
- Jules Eligible: NO
- Fallback Owner: agent2
- Retry Count: 0
- Session Health: HEALTHY
- Work Category: ENGINE_HOTFIX
- Start Date: 2026-02-25

## Objective

Hotfix the current Nebula topography rendering regression where the ground covers most of the screen with dense neon blocks and gameplay readability collapses.

Specific outcomes:
- restore clear ship/enemy/projectile readability
- ensure topography appears as hex-ground cues instead of full-screen filled bands
- keep deterministic chunk topography behavior intact

## Allowed Paths

- src/eras/era_future/nebula_bouncer/
- specs/nebula_bouncer.md
- docs/architecture/DESIGN.md
- agents/deliverables/agent2/
- agents/reports/agent2/
- agents/backlog/NB-A2-009.md

## Out of Scope

- No new game modes or gameplay balance changes.
- No asset creation outside existing Nebula ground/topography needs.
- No refactors outside Nebula runtime.

## Acceptance Commands

- cargo build --bin retro-game-game
- cargo test --lib nebula_bouncer
- cargo fmt -- --check

## Dependencies

- NB-QA-020 findings reviewed.
- NB-A3-003 deterministic topography data layer remains source-of-truth.
- NB-A4-011 visual baseline constraints.

## Definition of Done

- Topography rendering is visually bounded and no longer floods screen readability.
- Player ship is clearly visible during gameplay and no longer hidden by topography/floor layers.
- Projectile origin/direction remains coherent with visible ship orientation.
- Deterministic topography path still uses `global_seed + chunks_spawned`.
- Deliverable written to `agents/deliverables/agent2/NB-A2-009_hotfix_runtime_notes.md` with before/after behavior notes.
- Task report written to `agents/reports/agent2/NB-A2-009_task_report.md`.
