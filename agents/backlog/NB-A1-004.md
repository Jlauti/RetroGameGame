## Objective

Define a strict gameplay-facing contract for Nebula Bouncer's isometric-style 2.5D camera migration so runtime work can proceed without creative ambiguity.

## Allowed Paths

- specs/nebula_bouncer.md
- docs/architecture/DESIGN.md
- agents/deliverables/agent1/
- agents/reports/agent1/
- agents/backlog/NB-A1-004.md

## Out of Scope

- No runtime code changes under `src/`.
- No model creation or editing.
- No balance rework unrelated to camera/input mapping.

## Acceptance Commands

- cargo check --bin retro-game-game
- cargo fmt -- --check

## Dependencies

- Current Nebula 3D runtime baseline on `develop`.

## Definition of Done

- Spec contract is documented with concrete values and rationale:
  - camera mode (`orthographic`), pitch, yaw, zoom/scale baseline
  - gameplay plane definition and axis mapping
  - cursor-to-world mapping policy for aiming in isometric view
  - depth/readability policy for player, enemies, projectiles, terrain
- `specs/nebula_bouncer.md` and `docs/architecture/DESIGN.md` are updated consistently.
- Deliverable summary written to `agents/deliverables/agent1/NB-A1-004_isometric_contract.md`.
- Task report written to `agents/reports/agent1/NB-A1-004_task_report.md`.
