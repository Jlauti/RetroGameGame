# NB-A2-002 - Collision Damage Pipeline and Feedback Hooks

## Metadata

- Ticket ID: NB-A2-002
- Owner Agent: agent2
- Status: DONE
- Execution Lane: LOCAL
- Critical Path: YES
- Jules Eligible: NO
- Fallback Owner: agent2
- Retry Count: 0
- Session Health: HEALTHY
- Work Category: PHYSICS_HOOK
- Start Date: 2026-02-15

## Objective

Harden the orb collision pipeline so ricochet impacts apply enemy damage, manage orb lifecycle cleanly, and expose deterministic hook points for hit-stop and camera feedback systems.

## Allowed Paths

- src/eras/era_future/
- agents/deliverables/agent2/
- agents/reports/agent2/

## Out of Scope

- No broad refactors outside `era_future`.
- No art asset changes.

## Acceptance Commands

- cargo check
- cargo test
- cargo fmt -- --check

## Dependencies

- NB-A2-001 physics foundation.
- NB-A5-001 feedback systems.

## Definition of Done

- Enemy damage application from orb collisions is wired.
- Orb state transitions are deterministic under repeated collisions.
- Hook points are documented for feedback systems.
- QA signoff `PASS`.
