## Objective

Integrate `TechFighter.glb` as the Nebula Bouncer player ship in runtime:

- load the model via Bevy `AssetServer`
- replace sprite-based player rendering
- wire a top-down orthographic camera + lighting for model visibility
- keep movement, aiming, collision, and shooting behavior intact

## Allowed Paths

- src/eras/era_future/nebula_bouncer/
- specs/future/nebula_bouncer/asset_manifest.json
- specs/nebula_bouncer.md
- agents/deliverables/agent2/
- agents/reports/agent2/
- agents/backlog/NB-A2-004.md

## Out of Scope

- No enemy model integration in this ticket.
- No gameplay balance changes unrelated to model rendering.
- No cross-era rendering refactors.

## Acceptance Commands

- cargo build --bin retro-game-game
- cargo test --lib nebula_bouncer
- cargo fmt -- --check

## Dependencies

- NB-A4-008 `.glb` intake/validation baseline.

## Definition of Done

- Player ship renders as `TechFighter.glb` from manifest-configured path.
- Top-down orthographic camera and lighting are active in Nebula Bouncer play state.
- Existing player gameplay systems continue to function without behavior regression.
- Debug telemetry/overlay reflects model path and integration state.
- Task report written to `agents/reports/agent2/NB-A2-004_task_report.md`.
- QA signoff ticket (`NB-QA-017`) is prepared for execution.
