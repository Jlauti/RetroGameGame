# NB-A1-006 - Nebula Chase-Camera + Topography Contract

## Metadata

- Ticket ID: NB-A1-006
- Owner Agent: agent1
- Status: TODO
- Execution Lane: LOCAL
- Critical Path: YES
- Jules Eligible: NO
- Fallback Owner: agent1
- Retry Count: 0
- Session Health: HEALTHY
- Work Category: GAMEPLAY_SPEC
- Start Date: 2026-02-25

## Objective

Define a concrete contract for Nebula Bouncer's next visual pass:
- camera should feel more "behind" the player ship (lower angle perspective)
- player ship should read as closer to camera
- ground should use neon-hex topography cues (tiered elevation feel inspired by Star Goose terrain readability)

## Allowed Paths

- specs/nebula_bouncer.md
- docs/architecture/DESIGN.md
- agents/deliverables/agent1/
- agents/reports/agent1/
- agents/backlog/NB-A1-006.md

## Out of Scope

- No runtime code changes under `src/`.
- No asset creation.
- No QA signoff work.

## Acceptance Commands

- cargo check --bin retro-game-game
- cargo fmt -- --check

## Dependencies

- None.

## Definition of Done

- Deliverable written to `agents/deliverables/agent1/NB-A1-006_camera_topography_contract.md` with:
  - camera transform contract (pitch/yaw/distance/look target offset) and rationale
  - player framing policy ("closer" criteria and acceptable bounds)
  - neon-hex ground topography contract:
    - tier count/range
    - mapping from gameplay/procgen values to visual tiers
    - readability constraints for collisions/projectiles
  - `Esc`/settings compatibility notes with new camera/topography view
- `specs/nebula_bouncer.md` updated with camera/topography contract summary.
- `docs/architecture/DESIGN.md` updated with architecture notes for topography rendering policy.
- Task report written to `agents/reports/agent1/NB-A1-006_task_report.md`.
