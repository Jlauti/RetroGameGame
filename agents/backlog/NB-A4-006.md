- Scoped Test Command: python assets/scripts/check_bg.py c:\Users\jlaut\git\RetroGameGame/assets/sprites/future/nebula_bouncer --strict

## Objective

Produce gameplay-ready Nebula sprites from the latest approved candidate loop, close orientation/readability gaps, and deliver per-sprite metadata for runtime integration.

Generate multiple candidates per critical unit (player + enemy hulls), then promote only approved assets into canonical runtime filenames.

## Allowed Paths

- agents/art/reviews/
- agents/deliverables/agent4/
- agents/reports/agent4/
- assets/raw/future/nebula_bouncer/
- assets/sprites/future/nebula_bouncer/

## Out of Scope

- No gameplay code edits.
- No menu/UI redesign beyond direct Nebula gameplay sprite needs.

## Acceptance Commands

- python assets/scripts/check_bg.py c:\Users\jlaut\git\RetroGameGame/assets/sprites/future/nebula_bouncer --strict

## Definition of Done

- At least 3 candidate variants were generated and reviewed for each critical ship class (player, scout, heavy/interceptor), with explicit APPROVED/REJECTED outcomes documented.
- Updated canonical gameplay set: `sprite_player_ship`, `sprite_enemy_scout`, `sprite_enemy_heavy`, `sprite_enemy_interceptor`, `sprite_wall_tile`, `sprite_ground_tile`, `sprite_player_orb`.
- Every canonical sprite has a metadata entry (role, intended scale, pivot, orientation note) in `agents/deliverables/agent4/sprite_metadata_v2.json`.
- Review metadata exists at `agents/art/reviews/NB-A4-006_sprite_metadata.json` and includes `orientation_offset_deg`.
- No white backgrounds and no internal chroma-key holes.
- Human review board updated for any newly generated candidates.
- Task report submitted at `c:\Users\jlaut\git\RetroGameGame/agents/reports/agent4/NB-A4-006_task_report.md`.
