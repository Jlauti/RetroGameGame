## Objective

Implement Nebula Bouncer's next visual runtime pass:
- shift camera to a more behind-the-ship framing (lower viewing angle)
- bring player ship framing closer while preserving gameplay readability
- render topographical ground variation using neon hex motifs and tier cues

## Allowed Paths

- src/eras/era_future/nebula_bouncer/
- specs/nebula_bouncer.md
- docs/architecture/DESIGN.md
- agents/deliverables/agent2/
- agents/reports/agent2/
- agents/backlog/NB-A2-008.md

## Out of Scope

- No non-Nebula era refactors.
- No new gameplay systems unrelated to camera/topography rendering.
- No model creation/editing.

## Acceptance Commands

- cargo build --bin retro-game-game
- cargo test --lib nebula_bouncer
- cargo fmt -- --check

## Dependencies

- NB-A1-006 completed.
- NB-A3-003 completed.
- NB-A4-011 visual guidance available.

## Definition of Done

- Camera transform reflects approved behind-ship framing contract.
- Player remains controllable/aimable with deterministic cursor mapping.
- Neon hex ground rendering communicates at least 3 readable topography tiers.
- Topography visuals do not regress wall/projectile/enemy readability.
- Existing movement/collision/shooting behavior remains stable.
- Deliverable written to `agents/deliverables/agent2/NB-A2-008_camera_topography_runtime_notes.md`.
- Task report written to `agents/reports/agent2/NB-A2-008_task_report.md`.
