## Objective

Implement deterministic topography data output for Nebula chunks so runtime can render tiered neon-hex ground height cues.

## Allowed Paths

- src/eras/era_future/nebula_bouncer/procgen.rs
- src/eras/era_future/nebula_bouncer/resources.rs
- specs/nebula_bouncer.md
- docs/architecture/DESIGN.md
- agents/deliverables/agent3/
- agents/reports/agent3/
- agents/backlog/NB-A3-003.md

## Out of Scope

- No camera transform work.
- No menu/settings implementation.
- No gameplay balance retuning.

## Acceptance Commands

- cargo build --bin retro-game-game
- cargo test --lib nebula_bouncer
- cargo fmt -- --check

## Dependencies

- NB-A1-006 contract completed.

## Definition of Done

- Procgen schema includes a topography descriptor suitable for runtime rendering.
- Topography output is deterministic per chunk seed.
- At least one validator/test covers deterministic tier generation.
- Runtime-facing mapping notes are documented for agent2 handoff.
- Deliverable written to `agents/deliverables/agent3/NB-A3-003_topography_procgen_design.md`.
- Task report written to `agents/reports/agent3/NB-A3-003_task_report.md`.
