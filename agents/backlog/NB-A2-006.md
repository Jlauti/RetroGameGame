## Objective

Implement Nebula Bouncer's isometric-style 2.5D runtime camera/input migration while preserving existing 2D gameplay simulation (movement, collisions, projectile logic).

## Allowed Paths

- src/eras/era_future/nebula_bouncer/
- specs/nebula_bouncer.md
- docs/architecture/DESIGN.md
- specs/future/nebula_bouncer/asset_manifest.json
- agents/deliverables/agent2/
- agents/reports/agent2/
- agents/backlog/NB-A2-006.md

## Out of Scope

- No new gameplay features.
- No non-Nebula era refactors.
- No model creation work.

## Acceptance Commands

- cargo build --bin retro-game-game
- cargo test --lib nebula_bouncer
- cargo fmt -- --check

## Dependencies

- NB-A1-004 isometric camera contract approved.

## Definition of Done

- Camera is updated to the approved isometric-style orthographic setup.
- Cursor aim mapping remains deterministic against the gameplay plane.
- Player/enemy model transforms are coherent under isometric projection.
- Projectile, wall, and floor readability is acceptable in HITL pass notes.
- No regression in movement/collision/shooting behavior.
- Task report written to `agents/reports/agent2/NB-A2-006_task_report.md`.
