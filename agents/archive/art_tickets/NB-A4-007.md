## Objective

Produce a **complete, style-consistent gameplay sprite set** for Nebula Bouncer following the newly approved **dark synthwave neon** visual direction. This ticket consolidates and supersedes NB-A4-004 and NB-A4-006.

### Visual Direction (CTO-Approved 2026-02-21)

- **Reference**: Star Goose (1988), modernized with grimmer tone
- **Aesthetic**: Dark synthwave neon — NOT bright retro, NOT hyper-detailed concept art
- **Palette**:
  - Deep space black (`#0a0a12`) — background
  - Neon cyan (`#00ffff`) — player, friendly, UI
  - Hot magenta (`#ff00ff`) — enemies, danger
  - Electric purple (`#9b59f0`) — terrain accents, special items
  - Hazard orange (`#ff6600`) — warnings, heavy enemies
- **Ships/Enemies**: Dark hulls with neon edge glow. Silhouette-readable at 32-64px. Each archetype must be instantly distinguishable by shape alone.
- **Terrain**: Tile-based corridors — dark metallic panels, subtle circuit-line details
- **Tone**: Grim, intense, cyberpunk. Music is dark synthwave.

### Background Removal Protocol

> **CRITICAL LESSON LEARNED**: AI image generators do NOT produce real transparency when asked for "transparent background". They bake a fake checkerboard pattern into the RGB data. This checkerboard is nearly impossible to remove cleanly because the gray values overlap with dark ship hulls.

**Required approach**:
1. Generate sprites on a **solid bright green (#00ff00)** background for chromakey removal
2. After generation, run chromakey removal script to replace green with true alpha transparency
3. **Do NOT sacrifice sprite detail or quality** to accommodate the green background — the sprites should be just as detailed as they would be on any background
4. Verify final PNGs have RGBA mode with actual alpha channel
5. Tiles (wall/ground) do NOT need transparency — they fill the entire cell

The chromakey removal script is at: `assets/scripts/remove_green_bg.py` (to be created if not exists, or use PIL-based approach: threshold green channel high + red/blue channels low → set alpha to 0).

## Required Deliverables

### Sprite Set (8 canonical files)

| Filename | Role | Target Size | Style Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `sprite_player_ship.png` | Player | 128×128 | Angular stealth-fighter silhouette, cyan neon trim, dark hull, magenta exhaust |
| `sprite_enemy_scout.png` | Fast enemy | 64×64 | Small triangular drone, magenta glow, pointing down |
| `sprite_enemy_interceptor.png` | Medium enemy | 96×96 | Sleek diamond/chevron fighter, purple neon edges, weapon mounts |
| `sprite_enemy_heavy.png` | Tank enemy | 128×128 | Bulky hexagonal hull, orange warning lights, turrets |
| `sprite_enemy_bulwark.png` | Shield enemy | 128×128 | Wide cross shape, front cyan energy shield, magenta accents. **Must be visually distinct from heavy.** |
| `sprite_wall_tile.png` | Terrain wall | 64×64 | Dark metallic panel, cyan circuit lines, tileable |
| `sprite_ground_tile.png` | Terrain floor | 64×64 | Near-black metal, faint grid pattern, tileable |
| `sprite_player_orb.png` | Projectile | 32×32 | Glowing cyan energy sphere with halo |

### Quality Criteria

- All ship sprites must be **top-down orientation, facing up (player) or down (enemies)**
- Each enemy archetype distinguishable by **shape silhouette alone** (not just color)
- No internal green artifacts from bad chromakey
- No white backgrounds, no checkerboard remnants
- File sizes reasonable (under 100KB per sprite at target resolution)
- Tiles must be seamlessly tileable

### Metadata Deliverable

Produce `agents/deliverables/agent4/sprite_metadata_v3.json` with per-sprite:
- filename, role, pixel dimensions, intended in-game scale, pivot point, orientation_offset_deg

## Allowed Paths

- agents/deliverables/agent4/
- agents/reports/agent4/
- agents/art/reviews/
- assets/sprites/future/nebula_bouncer/
- assets/scripts/

## Out of Scope

- No gameplay code changes
- No menu/UI redesign
- No VFX sprites (existing ones are acceptable)

## Acceptance Commands

- `py assets/scripts/check_bg.py c:\Users\jlaut\git\RetroGameGame\assets\sprites\future\nebula_bouncer --strict`
- Visual HITL review by CTO (sprites must look detailed and interesting, not flat/boring)

## Dependencies

- Updated spec: `specs/nebula_bouncer.md` (visual direction section updated 2026-02-21)

## Definition of Done

- All 8 canonical sprites delivered at target resolutions with true RGBA transparency
- Sprites are visually cohesive — clearly part of the same game
- Metadata v3 JSON delivered
- CTO visual HITL review PASS
- Background validation script passes
