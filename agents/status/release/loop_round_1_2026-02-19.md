# Loop Round 1 Checklist (2026-02-19)

Loop: `LOOP-2026-02-18-nebula-gameplay-assetization`

## Objective

Execute the first production round for Nebula gameplay + assetization with explicit, testable outcomes.

## Round 1 Work Items

1. Finalize NB-CX-009 merge-readiness metadata and include in next merge wave.
2. Push NB-CX-011 from `READY_FOR_QA` to merge-ready path by reconciling gate/evidence artifacts.
3. Execute NB-A2-003 runtime integration follow-up work.

## Required Commands

```bash
python3 /home/jl/git/RetroGameGame/agents/scripts/validate_loop.py --loop /home/jl/git/RetroGameGame/agents/loops/LOOP-2026-02-18-nebula-gameplay-assetization.md
python3 /home/jl/git/RetroGameGame/agents/scripts/reconcile_ticket_state.py --root /home/jl/git/RetroGameGame --date 2026-02-19
python3 /home/jl/git/RetroGameGame/agents/scripts/build_release_board.py --root /home/jl/git/RetroGameGame --date 2026-02-19
python3 /home/jl/git/RetroGameGame/agents/scripts/gate_queue.py run-loop --wait-lock
```

## Acceptance Signals

- `NB-CX-009` no longer appears as stale metadata or TODO in readiness artifacts.
- `NB-CX-011` has complete QA + gate evidence and transitions to merge-ready state.
- `NB-A2-003` has active execution evidence (report progress and/or gate artifacts).
