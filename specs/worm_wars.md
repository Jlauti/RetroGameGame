# Worm Wars (Inspired by Worms, 1995)

## Aesthetic Goal
- **Era**: 1990s (Golden Age)
- **Palette**: 16-bit / High-color
- **Visuals**: Richer pixel art, parallax scrolling backgrounds.
- **Audio**: MIDI-style music, basic digitized sound effects (low bitrate).

## Modernized Mechanics
- **Physics Engine**: Use a modern 2D physics engine for projectile trajectories and terrain destruction.
- **UI/UX**: Better weapon selection wheel/menu.
- **Camera**: Smooth zooming and tracking of projectiles.

## Core Loop
- **Turn-based artillery** strategy.
- **Destructible Terrain**: 2D bitmap manipulation.
- **Teams**: Multiple teams of worms with individual health.
- **Arsenal**: Bazooka, grenades, shotgun, air strikes, special weapons.
- **Environmental**: Wind affects trajectories; water at the bottom is lethal.
